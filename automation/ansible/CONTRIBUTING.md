# Dotfiles Automation / Ansible

Welcome to the Ansible-infested underbelly of my dotfiles setup. This directory contains all the automation to transform a barren shell of a VM into a finely-tuned development environment — or at least, something I won't immediately regret logging into.

This setup is designed for me, fellow devs, and the occasional brave contributor. It aims to be reproducible, cross-platform, modular, and just opinionated enough to be dangerous.

## ⚒️ Dependencies

Make sure the machine you're running this from has:

- [Ansible](https://docs.ansible.com/) 2.15+
- SSH access to the target
- `python3` and common distro packages on the target system (Ansible will install others)
- Your SSH key loaded (private key must be accessible if copying it to remote VMs)

### 🧪 Development Tools

If you're contributing:

- [`ansible-lint`](https://ansible-lint.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for enforcing playbook best practices
  - Install with `brew install ansible-lint` or `pipx install ansible-lint`
- Optionally: `yamllint` to keep YAML files from turning into sad spaghetti

---

## 🔐 Assumptions

Every target VM is expected to have a user named `ansible` with passwordless sudo access. If you're running this against something that doesn't, you'll want to set up an appropriate sudoer entry or adjust your connection logic in `inventory/`.

This user may be used to bootstrap `dev_user`, copy over SSH keys, and perform installation tasks with elevated privileges.

| ------------- | ----------------- |
| Ubuntu        | 24.04             |
| Debian        | 12                |
| Kali Linux    | 2025              |
| Fedora        | 42                |
| CentOS Stream | 10                |

| RHEL          | 10 (Beta)         |

ARM and x86\_64 both supported. Special edge cases handled with a combination of duct tape and `set_fact` wizardry.
